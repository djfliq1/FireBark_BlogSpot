                    where I'm trying to go and of everyone I'm going with.</p>
                <p style="margin:19px;">Feel free to contact me at anytime in the networking section.</p>

                <p>The real start of my walk was 20 years ago when I joined the United States Navy. I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up but I had a family already and needed income. After I joined I had fun and was trained in a multitude of
                    electronic systems to include satellite, radar, navigation, and external communications systems. I knew I would retire eventually so I needed to figure out what I wanted to be as I was already grown up. I didn't know how to translate
                    the meat of my skillsets. It's easy to list a bunch of stuff, brag about how good you are at "xyz" but that didn't work for me. Every person I have ever worked for highly valued working with me and after asking they couldn't pinpoint
                    what it was that made me so vaulable either. They just knew they didn't want me leaving and going to a new duty station. I wondered for years about what I was going to do when I got out because what ever it was, I wanted it to be the
                    final career i would have then one day a friend of mine said one sentence that changed my life. He said "Hairston, your great at solving problems. Why do you think everyone comes to you?". This was brought up in the middle of a programming
                    conversation. I had never given programming any thought until this conversation and it hit me, he was asking me about programming because he knew I had the skills to get the answer he was looking for even though I had never touched
                    the language he was working with. Thats when I looked at my past and seen it was what I was looking for. So, like an amber of coal, its lite and keeps a blaze. If its not extinguished correctly, it can reignite causing unexpected effects.
                    I am that amber of coal. I was lit, I blazed, and when I reached the end of my Navy career, a dull burning amber reignited by the right mixture of fuel, air and heat and that is programming. FireBark was born!</p>
